# `go-libbb` &ensp;

`go-libbb` is a WIP GO library that aims to provide a friendly interface for common embedded functionality for the BeagleBone family of devices.

## Features
go-libbb will be feature-complete when the following interfaces are all implemented:
- [x] GPIO
- [ ] PWM
- [ ] ADC
- [ ] UART
- [ ] SPI
- [ ] I2C

Note: `go-libbb` is still in development meaning many of the features haven't yet been implemented.

## Usage
```bash
go get github.com/ekmecic/go-libbb
```
